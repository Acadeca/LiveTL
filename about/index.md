# Getting Started with LiveTL

You must have the [LiveTL extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livetl/moicohcfhhbmmngneghfjfjpdobmmnlg) installed to use LiveTL features.

To get started, visit your favorite streamer on YouTube. The chat should have some new buttons for launching LiveTL!
